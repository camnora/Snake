 * This was an awesome lab. I enjoyed being able to have freedom to challenge myself.
 * I feel like I learned a ton from this lab because I utilized some more advanced tools
 * such as Timers, Tasks, painting graphics, double buffering, and multithreading. 
 * I really hope we will have more labs where
 * we can work at our own pace. I plan to continue developing this game in my free time.
 * It would be awesome if I could somehow refactor this to an android platform.
 * Enjoy :)
